# Student-Management-System
This Python project implements a basic Student Management System to assist students in tracking their academic performance and behavior.
The system includes a login section for administrative access, providing a simple authentication mechanism. Once logged in, students can access various features:

1.Attendance Records:
Students input their attendance, and the system provides feedback on their eligibility for placement based on predefined ranges.

2.Test Marks:
Students enter their test marks and receive feedback on their performance, encouraging improvement if necessary.

3.Exam Marks:
Similar to test marks, students input their exam marks and receive a classification, ranging from Distinction to Fail.

4.Behavior:
Students report their behavior in the class, with the system providing feedback on whether it's considered good, bad, or invalid.

5.Students of The Year Award:
While the criteria for the "Students of The Year Award" are not explicitly defined in the provided code, this feature aims to recognize outstanding students based on certain performance criteria.

The system employs a straightforward if-else condition structure, making it easy to understand and modify. As the project evolves, additional features and criteria for the
"Students of The Year Award" can be incorporated. This project serves as a foundation for a more comprehensive student management system with expanded functionalities.
